Galápagos penguins are a monogamous species, each pair mating for life.[15] There are around 1,000 breeding pairs of Galápagos penguins in the world, and breeding depends on certain climate events. During El Niño, birds may not breed due to these climate conditions.[16] After completing courtship, with rituals including bill dueling, flipper patting, and mutual preening, the pair will build and maintain a nest.[9] Most nests are seen between May and July because both quantity of food and climate conditions are typically most optimal. The nests are made within 50 metres (160 ft) of the water on the shore. Adults stay near the breeding area during the year with their mate. It lays one or two eggs in places such as caves and crevices, protected from direct sunlight, which can cause the eggs to overheat.[15] Temperature of surface water also influences reproduction as they prefer temperatures between 17 and 22 °C (63 and 72 °F) to incubate, above 25 °C (77 °F) causes their nests to fail.[17] Incubation takes 38–40 days, with both parents incubating.[18]

One parent will always stay with the eggs or young chicks while the other may be absent for several days to feed.[19] A pair usually rears only one chick. Galápagos penguins will molt before they breed, and are the only penguins to do this twice a year. Molting takes up to 15 days to complete.[8] They do this for their own safety, as food availability in the Galápagos is typically unpredictable.[20] If there is not enough food available, they may abandon the nest.

It takes about 60–65 days for the chicks to become independent.[18] Newly hatched chicks have downy feathers that do not become waterproof until the chicks grow into juveniles.[20] The juvenile plumage, attained by thirty days after a chick hatches, is dark brown or gray above and white below. These feathers are mainly needed to protect the chicks from the strong sun rather than keep them warm.

Bermudian naturalist Louis L. Mowbray was the first to successfully breed the Galápagos penguins in captivity.

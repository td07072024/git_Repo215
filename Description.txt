The average Galápagos penguin is 48–50 centimetres (19–20 in) tall and weighs around 2–4 kilograms (4.4–8.8 lb).[7] It is the second-smallest species of penguin, after the little penguin. Females are usually smaller than males. Galápagos penguins have a black head with a white border running from behind the eye, around the black ear coverts and chin, to join on the throat. The top of the beaks are black and fade into pink on the bottom.[8] They have two black bands across the breast that connect to the back, the lower band extending down the flanks to the thigh.[9] Juveniles differ in having a wholly dark head, grayer on side and chin, and no breast band.

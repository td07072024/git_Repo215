Many years ago, the Humboldt Current is believed to have brought the penguins from mainland South America to the Galápagos Islands, where they have evolved in isolation into a separate species.[10] Islands such as Isabela Island contained cold and nutrient-rich waters that provided abundant food, ensuring the survival and reproduction of penguins.[10] Over millions of years, the penguins underwent adaptations, developing unique features that enabled their existence and allowed them to thrive under such an ecological niche.[10] Today, the Galápagos penguins are among the smallest penguin species.
